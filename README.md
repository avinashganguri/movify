## Project Goal:

The main idea of this project is to design a system that collects users reviews on the movie from social media which would be used to calculate the rating based on the sentiments of the users. The system collects all the comments that are associated for a specific movie and will calculate the average ratings for each movie and percentages will be displayed for each of them.

## Motivation:

Most of the websites would ask the users to give reviews, so the reviews inputted may or may not be genuine, so when we have observed these reviews we found that they are faulty and so we decided to build a project regarding this. We are collecting all the information from social media, as social media would have huge amount of data and mostly genuine data. We would get all the reviews from social media and based on these reviews we would calculate the percentages and display the results.

 ## Significance:

Inputting data from social media automatically would not manipulate the ratings or results in the application.
Handling/Analyzing huge amount of data input results more accuracy ratings.
The ratings and percentages would be calculated by the system and there will not be any human intervention, the ratings will be unbiased. 4.Top rated movies recommendations would be displayed based on the analysis made by the system.
Objective:


To create a Movie Rating System that automatically analyze the user opinions from social media using natural language processing and machine learning.

## System Features:

Login: Users can login into the system by creating their accounts in this system.

Search: User can search the movie and can view the ratings, synopsis and castings.

Sentimental Analysis: The system would calculate the ratings based on the sentimental analysis which internally uses Natural Language Processing.

Dashboard: Users would be able to view the top rated ten movies.
